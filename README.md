# Manchester Council Expenditure ETL Pipeline

Objective
Build an end-to-end ETL pipeline in Python to ingest, clean, and analyze Manchester City Council expenditure data. The project demonstrates practical data engineering skills—data extraction, transformation, validation, and loading—using a real-world financial dataset. Insights generated support transparency, financial analysis, and public sector decision-making.

Features
* Extracts council expenditure data from open CSV files
* Cleans and validates raw financial data
* Transforms data for analysis (e.g., categorization, aggregation)
* Loads processed data into a new CSV or database
* Generates summary analytics and visualizations

Dataset
* Source: Manchester City Council Open Data Portal
* Link: Expenditure Over £500
* Description: Contains records of council spending above £500, including date, department, supplier, and amount.

How to Run
1. Clone this repository
